## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We will be exploring the various factors that affect how wine tastes. Creating the perfect wine is always the goal of the winemaker, and through an analysis of our dataset, we will find the combinations of acids, sugars, sulphites and more that yield the top rated wines. Winemaking is an art almost as old as civilization itself, and while humans have been experimenting with different tachniques for centuries, most scientific experimentation with proper analysis has occured in the past 100 years. That means that there is still plenty of room to improve and polish the overall quality of wine that is produced. This dataset will allow us to analyze, piece by piece, not only what goes into whine, but what quantities of those ingredients produce the best overall quality of wine. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset includes thousands of different wines, both white and red, with the following variables: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, cholrides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and overall quality. Some of these variables, such as acidity and residual sugar, are controlled largely by the grapes themselves, prior to harvest, but are manipulated by the winemaker during fermentation. Of course, different grapes have different amounts of these variables naturally, however the style and length of fermentation directly impact the amounts of most variables present.
